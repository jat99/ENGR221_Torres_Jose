Class MySet 
Constructor:
    Input: List of Values
    Initializer: Use a dictionary to store values as keys for O(1) retrieval

Attributes:
    size, values, max_size

Methods:
    search, add, remove, traverse, isSet

    Search: 
        1. Check if set is empty
        2. Loop the length of the set
        3. if you encounter a match, then return True 
        4. if loop terminates and not match was found return False
    Insertion: The value can be inserted at any postion since order does not matter.
        1. Check if value is in set already, continue if it is not
        2. Check if there is enough space in current array
        3. If not enough space then update set, max length
        4. update length and insert new value into set
    Deletion: When deleting you need to update the set, length and potentially max length.
    I think swapping will work here because order does not matter and it will only be one operation and won't have to shift.
        1. Check if set is empty, this will end the function
        2. Loop the length of the set
        3. swap the value at the last index with matched index
        4. decrement lenght and convert last index to None
        5. This will leave extra space in array for future insertions
        6. Add code that will remove [None] if the array becomes large
    isEmpty:
        1. Return the length of the set
    traverse   
        1. Check if array is empty, if empty print empty
        2. if not empty then loop the set, up to the length attribute
